# github_battler

## This project uses the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and is built with React.

It was originally built using React class components, and was later refactored to comply with TypeScript and React Hooks.

There are multiple **views**, one of which allows a user to fetch popular repositories across a variety of programming languages.

The second main view provides input fields for a user to search for two GitHub users and battle them against one another in a GitHub popularity contest.
